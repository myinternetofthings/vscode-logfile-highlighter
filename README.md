# Log File Highlighter

![alt text][sample]

A Visual Studio Code extension for adding color highlighting to log files. It is based on standard conventions for log4net log files but hopefully it's general enough to be useful for other variations of log files as well. 

The extension associates with `.log` files and applies coloring to the following elements in the file:

* Dates and times in ISO format, such as
	* `2015-12-09`
	* `2015-12-09 09:29`
	* `2015-12-09 09:29:02,258`
* Log level, such as
	* `DEBUG`
	* `INFO`, `INFORMATION`
	* `WARN`, `WARNING`
	* `ERROR`, `FAIL`, `FAILURE`
* Numeric constants, such as
	* `1`
	* `234`
* Standard .Net constants
	* `null`
	* `true`
	* `false`
* String constants, enclosed in single or double quotes. Examples:
	* `"lorem ipsum"`
	* `'lorem ipsum'`
* .Net exception type names, i.e. word ending with `Exception`, such as
	* `ArgumentNullException`
	* `HttpException`
* .Net exception stack traces, i.e. lines starting with whitespace characters, followed by `at`, for example:
	```
	System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
		at MyClass.DoSomethingElse(string foo)
		at MyClass.DoSomething()
	```
